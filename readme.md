## Digital filters - VHDL 

Goal of this project is to make simple, adaptive script for digital filters using VHDL and FPGA device.

For testing purposes, there is sine wave (extracted from Matlab), amplitude of 1[V] and frequency of 50[Hz],
with noise, amplitude of 0.5[V] and frequency of 1000[Hz] (1[kHz]).
